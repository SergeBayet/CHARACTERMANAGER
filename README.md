## Goals
A client Comics fan would like to manage his favorites characters in a dashboard. He contacts us to create an app able to view, edit, create all his favorites characters.

In this project, we will use the Character Database API to make a Character Manager.

This is a frontend project, we have to care about the appearance of our application and create a custom template.
